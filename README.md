- In this one, it is possible to choose the number of moves, the third to test and make a joke, because if I were this site for the public, I would not have this option, as there is no space for three-digit numbers in the Scoreboard of the game.
- The whole game design was inspired by mickey and its classic colors.

<> Game.html

- I spent a lot of time on this part of the site, in particular, the layout is simple but with integration to be objective.
- The site is available for screens smaller than 320px for larger screens like full HD.

HOME

- Boot to return to home screen and hiring a home screen for home output, operator can choose home screen and choose another option (number of moves).
- Before it was only written "Home", but I decided to play the word for an icon (all icons in the game are from FontAnsowme), the text of changing the word for an icon was because I wanted it to take up less space on the screen, thus leaving the look cleaner.

RESTART

- Just like the "Home" button, the "Reset" button has also been replaced with an icon, for synced replacements.
- The "Restart" button refreshes the <> Game.html page.

SCOREBOARD

- The Score Board is just an attempt to mimic the shape of Mickey's head, without much ado. On the left ear is written "User" which should indicate to the user that the left side of the game (Points on the Board and Mickey's Hands on the left side) belongs to the user and the right side belongs to the PC.
- As I said, the numbers on the scoreboard were visually beautiful monkeys, as long as the number on both sides of the players was at most two digits, plus the numbers were off the board. I could solve this by just giving a point limit like 99, but I thought there was no need for that, so I would need this option like this, just for fun.

HANDS

- As maos eu tive que desenhar (Desenhei no Krita) e usei images do Google para me ajudar. Nao achei de imagens de maos nos formatos que eu queria com fundo trasparente para usar no site.
- Se eu tivesse mais tempo, gotaria de melhorar a aparencia das maos e do site no geral, pois is simples demais na minha opniao.

MAKE YOUR CHOICE:

- This sentence changes after the moves are made, through JavaScript code, the sentence can tell if the user crashed or lost the computer.
- The phrase is kind of boring, it informs the player in a tedious way, I wish I had thought of a better way to bring this to the user. I imagine the player wouldn't find it fun to read phrases like these hahaha. The sentence changes whenever the result of the move made is different from the previous one, but with more time available I could have saved it for the code to detect when the game ends and show a sentence on the screen informing the user that the game is and also adding and comparing the points of each player and determining who has the most points is the winner.
