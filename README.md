# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
 RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock Project

HTML
This part of the website is very simple as there was no need for complication.
- Board Score
to mark the user points and the PC points in an objective and easy to understand way.
- Hands
an image of clenched hands simulating the intro of the game just like in real life was included.
- Options
Two more play options have been added in addition to the traditional rock paper scissors to make the game less limited.
-Reset
so that the user has the facility to restart the game as often and whenever he wants.

CSS
- Unlike Html, I didn't save resources to give style to the website.
- the whole game design was inspired by mickey and its classic colors.
- tools like Krita were used to draw the hands in the formats needed for game development.
- despite many details written in the code, it did not interfere with the simplicity of the website, which was the intention from the beginning.
- on all icons that were made to be clicked, the a:hover feature was used so the user can be sure the icon is a click option.

JavaScript
- The first dilemma was how to make the site less static and boring, as the game should be practical and at the same time visually interesting, creating a movement would be necessary for that.
- after declaring all the variables that would be necessary to give orders to them, the "best of three", "best of 5" and "infinite" choice were made, the last option was left only for testing, as it would not be appropriate have a score greater than 2 digits for each player.
- the movement of the hands up and down was created to give a more interactive touch to the user and make it less boring and simple
